# MLP-Export-Value-Prediction-Project

Welcome to the MLP Export Prediction Repository ðŸŒ±ðŸŒµðŸŒ¿â˜˜. This project has to do with creating a multi-layer perceptron model that is capable of predicting the export value of agricultural products of countries around the world up to three years into the future.

## Project Description

For many countries, being able to predict the exporting power of a nation in advance can be beneficial in so many aspects. Some of them includes;
- Economic Planning and Policy Making: Accurate forecasts of export value can help the country to make more informed and prepared economic plans that can be beneficial to the nation as a whole. This can help to stabilize the economy and foster industrial growth.
- Business and Investment Decision: Companies can plan their production, inventory, and marketing strategies more effectively with reliable export forecasts. It can help in managing supply chains, reducing costs, and optimizing resource allocation. Investors also use export forecasts to evaluate the economic health of a country and make informed decisions about investing in that country.
- Risk Management and Currency Fluctations: Forecasting helps in identifying potential economic downturns or booms, allowing stakeholders to reduce risks associated with volatile market conditions. By predicting export trends, businesses can hedge against currency fluctuations and manage financial risks more effectively.
- Resource Allocation and Development: Accurate export forecasts can guide infrastructure development such as ports, logistics, and transportation networks to support increased trade volumes. It also aids in identifying and nurturing key sectors that have high export potential, thus driving sectoral development and economic diversification.

## About the Data

The dataset used for this project is made up of data extracted from the [FAOSTAT database](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home), which gives open access to food and agricultural data for over 245 countries and covers years from mid 1990s to present day.

The project Dataset contains 13 csv files, each covering a category of variables relevant to food and agriculture. Here are the 13 categories covered (with the corresponding FAOSTAT source for each category);

- Consumer prices indicators - [link](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/%23ata/CP)
- Crops production indicators - [link](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/%23data/QCL)
- Emissions - [link1](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/%23data/GCE) and [link2](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/%23data/GV)
- Employment - [link](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/%23data/OEA)
- Exchange rate -  [link](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/%23data/PE)
- Fertilizers use - [link](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/%23data/RFB)
- Food balances indicators - [link](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/%23data/FBS)
- Food security indicators - [link](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/%23data/FS)

## Setup
It is recommended that this project is ran on [Google colaboratory](colab.research.google.com) using a GPU because of the large computing power required to train and evaluate the neural networks model. [Google colaboratory](colab.research.google.com) also has most of the required tools and libraries needed to execute the project. Any tools that wasn't available was installed using PIP and to do the same, just uncomment and run the required code cell.

To use this repository,
- clone it to your local machine using the code below;
  ```git clone https://github.com/Dee-ui/MLP-Export-Value-Prediction-Project.git```
- Navigate to project directory;
    ```cd MLP-Export-Value-Prediction-Project```
- Run the .ipynb Notebook using [Google colaboratory](colab.research.google.com) to explore and execute the project ;
    ```jupyter notebook MLP_project.ipynb```
