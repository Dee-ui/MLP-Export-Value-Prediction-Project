The model can be either a regression model or a classification model.\n","\n","## Project Data Description\n","\n","The dataset used for this project is made up of data extracted from the [FAOSTAT database](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home), which gives open access to food and agricultural data for over 245 countries and covers years from mid 1990s to present day.\n","\n","The project Dataset contains 13 csv files, each covering a category of variables relevant to food and agriculture.
